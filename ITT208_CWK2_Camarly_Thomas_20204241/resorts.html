                    <dt><dl><strong>Blue Hole, Secret Falls</strong></dt>
                    <dd>Blue Hole is one of those breathtaking water attractions in Jamaica that’s a favourite for both locals and visitors to the island. <br>It’s a crowd-pleaser that has not been privatized, meaning it’s free to access and you’ll only be paying for your guide which you will discover is well worth the few bucks. <br>It’s close enough to Ocho Rios and awe-inspiring enough for you to make this trip a priority when visiting Jamaica.<br><br></dd>
                    <dt><strong>Why the name?</strong></dt>
                    <dd>Blue Hole is aptly named because of the unbelievably bright and beautiful turquoise water of the White River nestled high in the hills of St. Mary. <br>The river offers several sizes of natural swimming pools, plus a few caves to explore and a few waterfalls for climbing, rope swinging, and leaping.<br><br><br>
                    <dt><strong>What should I bring?</strong></dt><br>
                    <dd>Bring a sense of adventure and time to relax! Most guests also pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to dress for changing weather with layers of clothing.</dd></dl>

                    <!--                        <dt><dl><strong>What is Dunn’s River Falls</strong></dt>-->
                    <dd>Dunn's River Falls is believed to have been the site of the famous battle of "Las Chorreras", fought in 1657 between the Spanish and the English for possession of the island.<br><br></dd>

                    <dd>An entire day can be spent at Dunn’s River Falls and Park and it's great fun for the entire family.  <br>Climbing the falls might be too lofty a task for most children under five, however they can have their own fun in the Splash pad,  mini water park area designated for kids. <br>It’s complete with waterslides and an exciting feature where kids can get dunked with pouring water from the revolving buckets above.<br><br>
                        For the adventurous ones in the family they can go on an exhilarating whiz through the air with the Chukka Zipline over the falls. <br>You can choose to explore the falls yourself but it would be most fulfilling if you used a trained guide. <br>They will make the experience that much more enjoyable by taking pictures of you and your group, tell you the best places to swim and where to put your footing safely. <br>To assist you on the falls, water shoes are available just inside at the entrance of the park. <br>They are sold for US$17.00 per pair and rented at US$7.00 per pair. <br>On your way out of the park there is a craft market with unique tasteful ornaments, jewellery and clothing items that would be an excellent reminder of the time you spent in Jamaica.
